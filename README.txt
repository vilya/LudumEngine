Ludum Engine
============

This is my attempt at creating a properly reusable JavaScript game engine, from
the ashes of my previous Ludum Dare entries.

The core of it is an event-driven state machine which you use to string
together the logic for your game. On top of that it provides various other
optional (but useful!) components which can be enabled independently.

The library is still being developed. I hope to have it ready to use in time
for the next Ludum Dare competition.


Completed components
--------------------

- State machine
- Input tracking


Planned components
------------------

- Sprites
- 2D drawing
- Collision detection
- Resource loading (with progress feedback)
- Sound playback (effects & background music support)
